# Twitter Picture Bot
A Twitter bot that posts media files periodically.

## Tools Used
- [Google App Scripts](https://developers.google.com/apps-script) - A cloud-based JavaScript platform that lets you integrate with and automate tasks across Google products
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com/intl/en-us/drive/) - Personal Cloud Storage & File Sharing Platform
- [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api) - The Twitter API enables programmatic access to Twitter in unique and advanced ways

Every media file that can be tweeted is stored on a Google Drive account. The main script then pulls a random file from it, and tweets it out. Scripts can be edited from the Google Apps Scripts platform, and elements like periodic triggers for the script and overall project settings can also be managed.

## Dependencies
The [OAuth1](https://github.com/googleworkspace/apps-script-oauth1) library for Apps Script must be added to the project. This can be done from the platform's editor.

## Twitter account
The Twitter account used by this bot is [@bladerunnersbot](https://twitter.com/bladerunnersbot/)
